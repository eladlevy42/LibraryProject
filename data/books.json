Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power - the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as the Ring is entrusted to his care. He must leave his home and make a perilous journey across the realms of Middle-earth to the Crack of Doom, deep inside the territories of the Dark Lord. There he must destroy the Ring forever and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.",

      "short_description": "The Lord of the Rings is intended to be applicable to the real world of relationships, religion, pleasure, pain, and politics. Tolkien himself said that his grand tale of wizards, orcs, hobbits, and elves was aimed at truth and good morals in the actual world. Analysis of the popular appeal of The Lord of the Rings (on websites and elsewhere) shows that Tolkien fans are hungry for discussion of the urgent moral and cosmological issues arising out of this fantastic epic story. Can political power be wielded for good, or must it always corrupt? Does technology destroy the truly human? Is it morally wrong to give up hope? Can we find meaning in chance events? In The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy, seventeen young philosophy professors, all of them ardent Tolkien fans and most of them contributors to the four earlier volumes in the Popular Culture and Philosophy series, address some of these important issues and show how clues to their solutions may be found in the imaginary world of Middle-earth. The book is divided into five sections, concerned with Power and the Ring, the Quest for Happiness, Good and Evil in Middle-earth, Time and Mortality, and the Relevance",

Tolkien's almost stridently antimodern tale needed valiant defenders, vocal admirers who understood its sources and relished its monumental scale. While such champions of modernism as Edmund Wilson mocked Tolkien's archaic structure and language, W.H. Auden -- a great modernist poet in his own right -- rose to his defense with a spirited essay on the true nature of the Hero Quest. Edmund Fuller's essay collected here discusses the nature of the fairy tale, returning to the roots of the term to remove the treacle of Disney and restore the value of realistic enchantment. Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis takes up the question of why, if you have a serious comment to make about real life, you would drape it in a never-never land of your own. He shrewdly argues that it is because real life does have mythic and heroic qualities -- in abundance. This collection also includes, among others, essays by Marion Zimmer Bradley, Verlyn Flieger, Paul Kocher, Jane Chance, and each of the editors, as well as a brand-new essay by Tom Shippey that shows us how to process all this vast learning, adding to it the many delights of the film versions of Tolkien's epic masterpiece, so we can relish his achievement all the more.",

Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! Having become classics of our time, the Harry Potter eBooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism. With their message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new readers.",

      "short_description": "Harry Kaplonsky is a veteran of World War II, a survivor of the USS Houston's sinking in the South Pacific, and one of the few men still alive who can recount in detail the one thousand and fifteen days of captivity in the notorious Omori POW prison south of Tokyo. It is there Harry was tortured and beaten and witnessed countless atrocities including the murder of his best friend, Curly. Only problem, Harry can't seem to erase the event from his memories, and he sure can't seem to forgive his captors for the barbaric things which took place during his imprisonment. Now, sixty years later, he's angry and on a mission to sue the Obuchi government for an apology. Since his liberation in August, 1945, Harry's life has been spiraling downward, highlighted by one failed relationship after another, five marriages in total, all marred by battering and cruelty. For Harry the suit is more than a legal means to even the score, it is the last opportunity to lay blame for his own failings. Only days from death, Harry's litigation appears to be lapsing with his demise unless he can convince one of the other four Omori survivors to collaborate in the litigation. Unfortunately, all four despise him and won't enjoin the suit. Furthermore, the U.S. government is siding with the Japanese in hopes of winning trade concessions, and vows to fight Harry to the end. The government's legal team is led by none other than Harry's bastard son, Harold, turning the legal battle into a nasty family affair. All appears to be going adversely against the old veteran. Enter Tinker, an aspiring author in the throws of a literary dry spell. She is searching for the one great story (oddly, a non-fiction piece) to turn her fledgling career around. It is the television interview with Harry by Larry King, however, that motivates her into journeying to Texas for the annual USS Houston survivors' reunion and a shot at the rights to Harry's story. A victim of childhood physical abuse herself, Tinker's past soon becomes intertwined with Harry's, the battering both experienced providing common ground. During the course of the interview, Tinker discovers the dark secrets surrounding Harry and his seeming culpability in the deaths of five crewmates. It is this connection which has created a schism between Harry and the last of the Omori survivors. In the end, Tinker must not only reunite the five Omori brothers, she must also come to terms with her own past and forgive her estranged father.",

And why did it take Ron and Hermione so long to get together? Now, in The Psychology of Harry Potter, leading psychologists delve into the ultimate Chamber of Secrets, analyzing human mind and motivation by examining the themes and characters that make the Harry Potter books the bestselling fantasy series of all time.

      "short_description": "The enchanting prequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is the classic fantasy that inspired Peter Jackson’s major motion picture trilogy When Thorin Oakenshield and his band of dwarves embark upon a dangerous quest to reclaim the hoard of gold stolen from them by the evil dragon Smaug, Gandalf the wizard suggests an unlikely accomplice: Bilbo Baggins, an unassuming Hobbit dwelling in peaceful Hobbiton. Along the way, the company faces trolls, goblins, giant spiders, and worse. But as they journey from the wonders of Rivendell to the terrors of Mirkwood and beyond, Bilbo will find that there is more to him than anyone—himself included—ever dreamed. Unexpected qualities of courage and cunning, and a love of adventure, propel Bilbo toward his great destiny . . . a destiny that waits in the dark caverns beneath the Misty Mountains, where a twisted creature known as Gollum jealously guards a precious magic ring. © New Line Productions, Inc.
